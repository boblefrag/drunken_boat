The inevitable blog example
___________________________

First, install `drunken-boat` see :doc:`install`. Once drunken_boat
installed you can boostrap your first application with::

     drunken_run.py bootstrap example_blog

This will create for you all you need to start::

    cd /home/yohann/Dev/drunken_boat/example_blog
    python application.py

then visit http://localhost:5000/

If everything is fine you should see a bare "Hello World!" This it a
first victory but there is much more to do.
